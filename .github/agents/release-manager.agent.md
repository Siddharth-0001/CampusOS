Generate version number, changelog, and migration guide."

## Semantic Versioning Rules

### MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
  - Increment on breaking API changes
  - Requires migration guide
  - Update to v2.0.0, v3.0.0, etc.

- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
  - Increment when adding non-breaking features
  - Update to v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.

- **PATCH**: Bug fixes
  - Increment for bug fixes only
  - Update to v1.0.1, v1.0.2, etc.

### Pre-releases
- v1.0.0-alpha.1 (active development)
- v1.0.0-beta.1 (feature frozen)
- v1.0.0-rc.1 (ready for testing)
